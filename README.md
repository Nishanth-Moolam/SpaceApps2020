# SpaceApps2020

This is my repo for the Space Apps 2020 Challenge! I am choosing the Human Factors challenge

My plan is to find data for the 100 largest cites in the world including the following factors:

- population
- COVID-19 information since January
- Socioeconomic Status
- Population Movement
- Population Density
- Climate
- Age Distribution
- Government Subsidy given
- Unemployment rate
- Tests administered

From which I will make an AI model to predict the best and worse case future model for a city given certain factors.

The challenge asks to identify new factors that contribute to the spread of COVID
